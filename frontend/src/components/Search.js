// Refer to this link to understand how to implement Search functionality on instruments
// Basically have a text input element (with state) whose value will be used to filter through the instruments list provided to the component
// The filtering criteria can be determined by you but directly using .filter() method should work for now
// https://github.com/james-jasvin/Fullstack-Open-Course-Submissions/blob/master/part2/phonebook/src/App.js

// Use instruments for searching and watchlists for showing which watchlist to add instrument to
const Search = ({ watchlists, instruments }) => {
  return (
    <div></div>
  )
}
